## About React vite

CRA or create-react-app is no longer recommended, as even the React core team doesn't recommend it. Nowadays, it's the era of server-side rendering, and even for CRA, bug fixing has started to slow down. So they recommend switching to something else.

## How to run

Follow the step:

```
$ cd frontend/
$ npm install
$ npx prettier --write . && npm run dev
```
